* Adjustment of slider

User may also explore the different factors related to climate change by choosing a different selection from the dropdown menu.

## Technologies

The d3.js library was utilized extensively to create interactive events as well as construct the data visualizations for each factor.

## Future Improvements

* Include the ability for users to adjust year ranges for each factor.
* Provide data for other indicators of climate change such as Artic Sea Ice Minimums and Antartica Land Mass measurements.
* Include a polar graph including all factors analyzed that updates as the year is adjusted by the user.
* Further refine the user interface by adding instructions on how to utilize the tool.
